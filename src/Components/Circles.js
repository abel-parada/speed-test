// I create the 4 circles here! and I call them later in the return area using the key/value pair. The colors are being used as a classnName to be able to call them in the Apps.css

export const circles = [
    {id:1, color:"green"},
    {id:2, color:"yellow"},
    {id:3, color:"blue"},
    {id:4, color:"brown"}
  ];
